# SigZyme

Efficient batch decomposition of time series data.

SigZyme implements the main data-driven methods of breaking down multicomponent (and possibly non-stationary) signals. Building on PyTorch, it allows to break down batches of 1D signals simultaneously and to seamlessly make use of a CUDA-enabled GPU, if available.
